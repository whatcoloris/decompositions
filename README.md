This is a GitHub library for the album/project/software/compositional system "11 Attempted Decompositions" by Brian McCorkle

Decompositions are compositions in reverse, there is no "seed of an idea" in a romantic sense, there are only attempts to frame the situation and the people involved by the decomposer.

This project is supported through a Workspace Residency at Harvestworks (harvestworks.org)

The 11 Decompositions are:
1. Distance
The composition reacts to your distance.
2. Light
The composition communicates through light.
3. Timbre
The composition is excited by your timbre.
4. Loudness
The composition is interested in your loudness.
5. Note
The composition hears all the notes.
6. Meaning
The composition attempts to ascertain meaning.
7. Contact
The composition responds to contact.
8. Conversation
The composition responds to vocal information.
9. Periodicity
The composition attempts to find cycles - it is encouraged to repeat.
10. Presence
They wish to be there.
11. Absence
They are not there.

Broken down from most through-composed to most improvised.

In each one the software is primarily paying attention to something else.
